            <p class="intro">
                Welcome to my website about rats! This is where I store all the facts I love about my sweet little friends. In my humble opinion, rats are some of the greatest creatures on this earth. They are kind,
                smart, great problem solvers, and amazing friends. Most things you hear about my little friends is negative. They are known as pests, unwanted neighbors, unlovable creatures. We often overlook their
                amazing qualities. Don't even get me started on how unfair the black plague being pinned on them is. It wasn't their fault! Those people didn't bathe! Please feel free to learn about my favorite\
                subject. If you find the creatures unworthy, remember compassion, and witness their greatness! And their cute little wiskers!
